      <h2>My Travel Experiences</h2>
      <p>Another thing I love to do is travel. I love meeting new people, learning about their cultures, trying new foods, and also collecting souvenirs from all the places I have been.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I love to photograph my experiences of the places that I visit, as a way of keeping the experience with me.</p>

                  <h3>California, USA</h3>
                  <p> I came to California for the first time in 2019, when I first moved to the US to go to Stanford. </p>
                  <p>There are many things I love about Palo Alto, but my favorite thing is when the entirety of University Avenue is decorated for the festive season in the winter. </p>
                  <p>Other places I have visited in California which I loved are the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Pier 39</p>

                  <p> On the East Coast, I have been to Connecticut, Boston, Massachussets and New York, to visit family and friends.

                  <h3>Accra, Ghana</h3>
                  <p> I was born and raised in Accra. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to go to some other pparts of the country such
                      as Kumasi, the Eastern Region and the Central Region. Ghana has a vibrant culture, vibrant people, and the best food. My favorite experiences in Accra 
                      are going to the beach, as well as visiting resorts like the Aqua Safari Resort.

                  <h3>Tunis, Tunisia</h3>
                  <p> I visited Tunisia when I was 8 to see some family. Unfortunately, at the time, I was too young to have a phone, and so do not have any photos. 
                      I do remember that we visited the zoo and one of the zoo keepers put me on a camel without my permission for a picture.

                  <p> I visited Kigali with the Human Rights Club of my highschool as part of a project we were undertaking regarding the Rwandan Genocide of 1994.

                      as well as visit the astonishing Inema Arts Center.

                  <p> I visited South Africa for a Model UN Conference. Outside of the conference, my friends and I got to go to museums dedicated towards 
                      educating people about the Apartheid. We also got the chance to see the city's beautiful scenery, as well as visit the commercial center of the city.

                  <h3>Bath, United Kingdom</h3>
                  <p> Bath is a very unique town. During the time I spent in this city, I visited the city center, a buzzing hub where most of the activity of the city takes place. 
                      One of the best travel experiences I have had was going to the the Longleat Animal Park. In addition to seeing a lot of cool wild animals, and driving 
                      in a safari with monkeys hanging on the cars, we also got to explore an ancient castle!  </p>

                  <h3>Krakow, Poland</h3>
                  <p> I visited Krakow with the Human Rights Club of my high school. This is my most memorable travel experience. In Poland, we visited the aushwitz Concentration Camp, the 
                      Jewish Quarter in Krakow, and other beautiful museums, to learn more about the Holocaust. On this trip, we also spent time in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Berlin, Germany,

                  <p> One of the best travel experiences I have had yet! The city of Cluj has an ancient feel, all while having a vibrant modern section of the city 
                      within a 15 minute drive. In Cluj, I visited many beautiful old churches, as well as other historically significant locations. We got to explore some ancient 
                      castles in Alba Julia, and also visit Salina Turda, which is an old salt mine turned into an amusement park! (There is a whole amusement park about 20
