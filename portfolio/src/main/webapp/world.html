      <h2>My Travel Experiences</h2>
      <p>Another thing I love to do is travel. I love meeting new people, learning about their cultures, trying new foods, and also collecting souvenirs from all the places I have been.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I love to photograph my experiences of the places that I visit, as a way of keeping the experience with me.</p>

                  <h3>California</h3>
                  <p> I came to California for the first time in 2019, when I first moved to the US to go to Stanford. </p>
                  <p>There are may things I love about Palo Alto, but my favorite thing is when the entirety of University Avenue is decorated for the festive season in the winter. </p>
                  <p>Other places I have visited in California which I loved are the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and Pier 39</p>
