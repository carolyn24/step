      <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
      <h3>STEP Intern, Google LLC</h3>
      <p>This summer, I have the opportunite to work at Google as a Student Training in Engineering Program (STEP) Intern. In these first few weeks, I 
          have enjoyed all that I have learnt from the program, including building this portfolio. I look forward to interacting more with other Googlers, shadow 
          Software Engineers, and learn more about what it means to be an Engineer at Google.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>Some projects that I have worked on include BabyGraphics, a project where I had to develop an algorithm that tracked the popularity of baby names in the US over the last two decades, and then 
          had a graphical user interface which allows people to search up names and see the trends for that name in the form of a graph. I also worked on a project where I developed a basketball game with Scratch, 
          and another one where I developed an algorithm that would generate the most efficient schedule for doctors and patients, so all patients could be efficiently consulted, given the doctor's hours of availabilty 
          and the patient's needs.
      </p>

     <h3>On-Campus Employment, Stanford University</h3>
      <p>At my college, I work as a student staff at the Stanford Center for African Studies. Here, I work with other student staff members as well as the Director of the Program
          to facilitate events annd other functions of the institution. I also work as a student staff member of the Stanford Clayman Institute for Gender Research, where I work with faculty, 
          graduate fellows and postdoctoral students in encouraging and facilitating gender equality in research and education.
      </p>

      <h3>Programming Languages </h3>
          <p>The programming languages that I am efficient in are Python, C++ and C. I have an adequate level of efficiency in Assembly as well, and I am currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaSript.</p>

      <h3>International Mathematics Olympiad</h3>
      <p>In 2018 and 2019, I was honored to be on the teams representing Ghana at the International Mathematics Olympiad in Romania and the Unkted Kingdom respectively.
          Before these I participated in the Ghana Mathematics Olympiad from 2014 to 2019. These competitions taught me to challenge myself and always engage in critical thinking.
