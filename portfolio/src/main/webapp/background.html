      <p>My name is Carolyn Akua Asante-Dartey (born May 24, 2000) and I use she/her pronouns. I come from Accra, Ghana. I am an international student at Stanford University, where I am a rising sophomore, 
          studying Computer Science. Some things that I like to do are reading, swimming, cooking, and watching movies and TV shows. I love to listen to music, and I love to challenge myself by learning new skills. 
          I attended Alsyd Academy for primary school, Wesley Girls High School for my first two years of high school, and Lincoln Community School, where I got my IB diploma. In school, my favourite classes are usually STEM classes.

          I come from a family of 5, I have a younger brother and a younger sister. I speak two languages; English, and my local language Twi. Back home, I was a member of the church band and
          I played the saxophone at my church every weekend. Some genres of music I enjoy are AfroBeats, RnB, pop, hip hop and jazz music. I love to draw and design as well.
          Some communities at Stanford that I am a part of include the Stanford African Students Association, where I work as the Financial Officer,  the Society of Black Scientists and Engineers and Women in Computer Science. 
          I also love to travel with my friends and family. Click <a href="world.html">here</a> to find out more about my travel adventures!
           <br>
          Some of my favorite TV Shows are Prison Break, Suits, How to Get Away With Murder, All American, and Merlin. I am a huge fan of the Avengers and I love to go for concerts. 
          I like to meeet new people, make new friends and learn about their backgrounds. I believe every person is unique and has a special element. <br> </p>
